# Flashcards

A simple, CLI-based application that allows the simple
creation of "flashcards". 

To use, simply place a CSV file with the following format in the directory
with main.py:

`text for front of card1, text for back of card1`\
`text for front of card2, text for back of card2`

The CSV can contain as many items as you need, but extremely lengthy
files may take longer to generate in the beginning.
